# genetic-ants
Genetic algorithm ideas playground using an ant simulator

## Why does this exist?
I was bored on a long drive from New Orleans, LA to College Station, TX in Aug 2019.
I've kept noodling on it very occasionally since then. Most of the rest of it I made on the plane from LAX to Hong Kong. Figured I'd make it public because my github is suspiciously empty of public projects, and I can't make most of my real projects public for ITAR & trade secret reasons. 

## Running this project
Just install the python libraries included at the top of ants.py and run using python3.

Run the program to watch some colorful ants try to survive and perpetuate their genetic line 
in a harsh environment of black walls and no food. Maybe later
I'll add food if I'm bored on another long trip.

## Vague Project Objectives
- Explore a simple solution space with a genetic algorithm.
- Display that exploration in real time
- Become more fluent with numpy and matplotlib
- Fiddle around with interesting linear algebra techniques in a project setting.
