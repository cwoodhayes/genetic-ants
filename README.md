# genetic-ants
Genetic algorithm ideas playground using an ant simulator

This is a programming project I started on a long drive from New Orleans, LA to College Station, TX in Aug 2019.
I've kept noodling on it very occasionally since then. Most of the rest of it I made on the plane from LAX to Hong Kong. 

Run the program to watch some colorful ants try to survive and perpetuate their genetic line 
in a harsh environment of black walls and no food. Maybe later
I'll add food if I'm bored on another long trip.
